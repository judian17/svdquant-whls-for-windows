# svdquant-whls-for-windows
Unofficial Windows wheel package for the [Nunchaku](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/nunchaku) (SVDQuant) library.
Compiled for use with RTX 4060 Ti 16GB GPUs; it will likely not work on 30-series or earlier GPUs.
I'm also new to programming, and with the help of AI, I finally succeeded in setting up the compilation environment on my own. So, I'd like to provide convenience for others who want to try SVDQuant, and I hope it will be helpful to you.

非官方的svdquant的nunchaku库的windows版本的whl文件
编译使用显卡为RTX4060TI 16g，大概无法在30系及更早期显卡上使用。
我也是编程新手，利用AI终于自己成功编译环境，所以想为其他想尝试svdquant的人提供便利，希望对你有所帮助
